## The challenge 
* There were two goals in this challenge. 
* The part A of the challenge consists in automatically classifying H&E stained breast histology microscopy images in four classes: normal, benign, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma. 
* The part B consists in performing pixel-wise labelling of whole-slide images in the same four classes. For these purposes, challenge participants will be provided with approx. 400+ labeled microscopy images, and 10 pixel-wise labeled and 20 non-labeled whole-slide images. 
This challenge is a follow-up of the one of Bioimaging2015
